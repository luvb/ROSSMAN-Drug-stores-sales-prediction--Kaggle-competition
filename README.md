#ROSSMAN-Drug-stores-sales-prediction--Kaggle-competition
The goal of Rossmann Kaggle competition is to forecast the daily sales of 1115 Rossmann stores located across Germany using store, promotion, and competitor data. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Feature engineering was performed to collapse few variables and new features were built. Developed prediction models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Xgboost. Random forest with parameter tuning gave us the best result in terms of RMPSE of 0.14
